# asteroids
asteroids created in pygame (following boot.dev course for base game pre-extensions)

## extensions
hoping to add the followning extensions :
* Add a scoring system [X]
* Add acceleration to the player movement, probably need tweaking [X]
* Make the objects (player,asteroids?,shots?) wrap around the screen instead of disappearing [X]
* Start + Restart screen
* Implement multiple lives and respawning
* Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
* Use triangle hitbox for player?
